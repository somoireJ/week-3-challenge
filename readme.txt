Instructions:
 Create a Task constructor function that takes in a title, description, and status as parameters and creates an object with these properties.
 Create a TaskList object that has an array of tasks and methods to add, edit, and delete tasks.
 Create a TaskController object that has methods to handle user interactions and update the task list accordingly.
 Use HTML and CSS to create a simple user interface for the website.
 Use JavaScript to create instances of the Task, TaskList, and TaskController objects and use their methods to add, edit, and delete tasks.
 Use JavaScript to update the user interface to reflect the changes to the task list.
Tips:
 To add a task, you should create a new instance of the Task object and push it to the task list.
 To edit a task, you should find the task in the task list and update its properties.
 To delete a task, you should remove the task from the task list.
 To update the user interface, you can use the DOM API to manipulate the HTML elements.
 Make sure to use the this keyword correctly and to use closure to keep the task list and other internal state private.
 Remember that the task list should be a property of the TaskList object and not a global variable.
 You can use the localStorage API to store the task list and retrieve it when the website is reloaded.
 Use appropriate classes and ids for the HTML elements to make it easy to select them with JavaScript.
 Make sure that the JavaScript code is well-organized and easy to understand.
 You can use a library like jQuery to make it easier to work with the DOM, but it is not required.
 You can use a library like Lodash or underscore to help with the operations on the task list.
 Make sure to test your code and fix any bugs.
 Make sure your website is responsive and works on desktop and mobile devices.
